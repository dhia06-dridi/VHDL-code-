**Examples of Functions Developed in VHDL and Simulated with ModelSim**

> Different examples of functions, such as: ALU, 7-segment display, all logical functions (like XOR, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR), all types of flip-flops (RS, D, JK, T), counters, decoders, multiplexers, demultiplexers, adders, subtractors, shift registers, comparators, clock dividers, encoders, decoders, and other logical and arithmetic components, developed in VHDL and simulated using ModelSim.
